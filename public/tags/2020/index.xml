      <description>What do I mean by sexy programming languages? I refer to programming languages as sexy if they are not yet mainstream, but have plenty of buzz around them. They usually have a small but very energetic community, but may be lacking mature libraries here and there due to their only recent stardom. This also provides opportunities for ambitious developers to contribute to open-source. Therefore my list will exclude any mature languages like: Java, Python, C#, PHP and JavaScript.</description>
