I decided to upgrade my laptop memory this year. While my coding work rarely pushes memory usage above 75%, I recently started doing a lot of Lightroom editing and occasionally video editing as well. I noticed that I was frequently using 15 of 16 GB of memory and I decided to bump it up to 32 gigs. I also heard that the next generation of SSD is coming out soon and will not be compatible with the interface this laptop is using so I decided to ugprade, the storage on the laptop was well to 1TB.</description></item></channel></rss>
