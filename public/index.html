      <div class="content">
        I have been using Cmder for about a year now, it&rsquo;s an excellent console emulator for Windows based on ConEmu emulator, but with a few bells and whistles thrown in. I got it mainly for the tabs and split screen features (which ConEmu also supports), but Cmder looks cooler and has Git support out of the box. At work I like to have git for front-end open on the left side and git for back-end open on the right side; then I have another tab open for yarn commands.

      <div class="content">
        This question is very common on interviews, and while fairly straightforward, plenty developers mess it up on the interview.
What is a palindrome? Webster dictionary defines it as a word, sentence or number that reads the same forwards and backwards. Some examples are: dad, 1881, abba.
There are a few approaches to solving this problem, we can reverse the array of characters and compare the resulting string for example. The more efficient way of doing this is to compare the characters from the beginning and from the end one-by-one.

      <div class="content">
        As a means of keeping my logic sharp and helping others prepare for Go interviews I decided to release a solved interview question every week or so.
In this post, let&rsquo;s write a function in Go that generates us all the primes at or below a specific integer.
To even attempt this question, we need to know the exact definition of a prime number. According to Wolfram, A prime number is a positive integer p&gt;1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and p itself.

        Why you may want to chunk files? The biggest reason for me to upload files in chunks, is because I want to upload very large files; pictures, videos, whatever&hellip; This means, I want to know the status of the upload as it progresses and if I can&rsquo;t finish the upload now, I want to be able to pause, go to my favourite coffee shop and continue on there.
Let&rsquo;s build a simple app using no additional javascript libraries!

        Setting up GORM Continuing from the app we created in Part 1
PostgreSQL is one of the most popular database choices today because it is free and has most of the features that the big guns like Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle offer. To connect our microservice to PostgreSQL, we can simplify our life by using an ORM for GO called GORM&hellip; GO-ORM get it?

Let's upgrade the gRPC microservice we created in Part 1 to use an actual database instead of just cache.

      <div class="content">
        What do I mean by sexy programming languages? I refer to programming languages as sexy if they are not yet mainstream, but have plenty of buzz around them. They usually have a small but very energetic community, but may be lacking mature libraries here and there due to their only recent stardom. This also provides opportunities for ambitious developers to contribute to open-source. Therefore my list will exclude any mature languages like: Java, Python, C#, PHP and JavaScript.

        Summary - Setting up gRPC communication gRPC is a modern, highly-efficient method of communication between systems built by Google. gRPC uses the new and efficient HTTP/2 network protocol as well Google&rsquo;s Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) method of serialization which allows for more light-weight and predictable communication. Protocol Buffers can be used with any technology stack out there; code can be generated from the .proto file for nearly every programming language available.

Plugin, what? Go plugins are a fairly new addition to Golang (support starting with Go 1.8), but they provide a very innovative way to add functionality to a Go application.

People traffic here is very intense on the weekends though. Taken with: Pixel 2 XL    There is a small floating market inside the Icon Siam Shopping Center. How cool is that! Taken with: Pixel 2 XL    Icon Siam has plenty of venues that sell Mango sticky rice. If you are visiting Thailand, this is a must-try dessert.  Taken with: Pixel 2 XL    If your bank account is too large you can do some serious shopping at Icon Siam. This shopping center is very beautiful, it's worth visiting at least once.  Taken with: Pixel 2 XL    Rainy day on Khao San Road. Lots of quirky and unique shops here, although many tourist traps as well.  Taken with: Pixel 2 XL    I love the vibe of Khao San Road, it may be overrun by scammers in some spots, but I can't deny the uniqueness of this place.  Taken with: Pixel 2 XL    Chinatown in Bangkok is vast, colorful and lively. Taken with: Pixel 2 XL    River-view from one of my favourite restaurants, Viva Aviv The River Taken with: Pixel 2 XL    Beautiful sunset view of the city Taken with: Pixel 2 XL    Ratchada Rot Fai Train Night Market is absolutely amazing. The variety of food at amazing prices is mind-boggling!  Taken with: Pixel 2 XL    My workstation setup in Bangkok so far. This is where the magic happens.  Taken with: Pixel 2 XL
