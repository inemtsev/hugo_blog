My name is Ilya, and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer working in Bangkok, Thailand. I grew up in Canada, and I completed my Undergraduate studies in Applied Mathematics. I am a completely self-taught programmer and I am still hungry for more. Hopefully you find something interesting in my blog posts.
